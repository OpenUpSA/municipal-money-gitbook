![Static state of calculations block](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (15) (1) (1).png>)

Added combo classes to `.indicator-calculation__formula-actual` for targetting the different blocks. These classes are `.is--post-2019-20` and `.is--pre-2018-19.`

``![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (14) (1).png>)

Changed the styling of these blocks to have a slight grey background so they are more easily identifiable as separate items. Also added headings for each.

Removed a mistake in class naming of `.indicator-calculation__formula-actual` where the class name in Webflow included a full-stop at the beginning. **This may affect how these classes are targeted.**
