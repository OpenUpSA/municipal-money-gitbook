### 2023/03/23 - added missing url to "see more videos"&#x20;

### 2023/03/14 - fixed disabled state

I have changed the styling of "dropdown-toggle--grey" back to what it originally was. Please use "dropdown-toggle--disabled" in order to de-active and style dropdowns that only have 1 option.

### 2023/03/10 - Changes to help language and size dropdowns

{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/municipalmoney.webflow (help-video-dropdown-changes).zip" %}

* Adjusted the widths of the size and language dropdowns to avoid resizing
* Added truncation to the dropdown toggle to avoid "dropdown\_\_current-select" from moving elements around and breaking the UI.
* Made changes to "dropdown-toggle--grey" to ensure it is more obviously different from a clickable dropdown. Changed pointer to "default" not pointer finger when class is applied.&#x20;
* Added "pointer-events: none;" to the grey class so that there is no hover or click interaction on disabled dropdowns.
