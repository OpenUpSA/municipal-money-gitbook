National Bill Totals
{% endfile %}

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/SERVICE_TOTALS_2020.csv" %}
National Service Totals
{% endfile %}

Using these files follow the steps below:

1. Ensure the correct financial year exists, if not add it.
2. On the 'Data set files' page, click on ADD DATA SET FILE+
3. Find and select the relevant .csv file.
4. In the dropdown menu select Service Totals or Bill Totals as the data type.
